# Personnal Project: Your Own LyraT Program 

The remaining course (approximately 3 TD of 2h) will be dedicated to a personal project that you will implement on LyraT, the idea it to explore further one aspect of the LyraT programming and to present it to the other students in a small d√©mo during the last course.

# Possible Projects

You are encouraged to proposed your own project, here are some idea of topics that can be studied. Note that the project will be done in **a very short time**, make sure to be able to present something, even if it is juste a study for a future implementation

* Explore Digital Synthesis or effect on the web (e.g., <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sound_synthesis_types>, <https://www.dafx.de/>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_effect#techniques>, <https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/>, etc.), and implement a particular algorithm
* Provide an OSC control via  udp connection with Wifi
* Provide a BlueTooth/midi controler such as the one implemented here (<https://github.com/midibox/esp32-idf-blemidi/tree/master/components/blemidi>)
* Provide a USB/midi controler with an external midi/uSB device
* Think of a funny application using wireless communications between several LyraT
* Provide an HTTP server that can be used via wifi to control the LyraT program
* Explore (as above) digital synthesis of effect but in Faust to LyraT

#Rules:
<ul>
<li> <b>One or two students</b> per project </li>
<li> project <b>should be presented</b> to the class "as it is" on last course <b>in less than 10mn</b> (e.g. three slides and a demo)</li>
</ul>
