# Personnal Project: Your Own LyraT Program 

The remaining course (approximately 3 TD of 2h) will be dedicated to a personnal project that you will implement on LyraT, the idea it to explore further one aspect of the LyraT programming and to present it to the other students in a small d√©mo during the last course.

# Possible Projects

You are encouraged to proposed your own project, here are some idea of topics that can be studied. Note that the project will be done in <b> a very short time </b>, make sure to be able to present something, even if it is juste a study for a future implementation

<ul>
<li> Explore Digital Synthesis or effect on the web <https://smc2020torino.it/uk> (https://smc2020torino.it/uk), [https://nime2020.bcu.ac.uk], [https://www.dafx.de/], [https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/]), and implement a particular algorithm </li>
<li> Provide an OSC control via  udp connection with Wifi </li>
<li> Provide a BlueTooth/midi controler such as the one implemented here (link to come) </li>
<li> Provide a USB/midi controler with an external midi/uSB device </li>
<li> Think of a funny application using wireless communications between several LyraT </li>
<li> Provide an HTTP server that can be used via wifi to control the LyraT program</li>
<li> Explore (as above) digital synthesis of effect but in Faust to LyraT
</ul>

#Rules:
<ul>
<li> <b>One or two students</b> per project </li>
<li> project <b>should be presented</b> to the class "as it is" on last course <b>in less than 10mn</b> (e.g. three slides and a demo)</li>
</ul>
